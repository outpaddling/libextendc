.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ff_close(3)
closes a xt_ff_t stream with xt_ff_close(3) or xt_ff_pclose(3) as appropriate.
Automatically determines the proper close function to call using
S_ISFIFO on the stream stat structure.

The xt_ff_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The value returned by xt_ff_close(3) or xt_ff_pclose(3)
