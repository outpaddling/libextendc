.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B romantoi() function converts a string containing a valid
Roman numeral to an integer, much like strtol().  It rejects
non-normalized values, such as IIIII, XXXXX, or CCCCC, which
should be written as V, L, and D, respectively.  IIII, XXXX, and
CCCC are accepted in place of IV, XL, and CD.  Any number of
consecutive Ms (1000s) are accepted, since there is no larger digit.
Like strtol(), it returns the
address of the first character not converted as part of the
number.  This can be used to verify that the number ended as
it should have, perhaps with a '0' byte.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The integer value of the Roman numeral if converted, or 0 if
an invalid numeral is detected.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

char    string[] = "XIV", *end;
int     n;

n = romantoi(string, &end);
if ( *end == '0' )
    printf("%dn", n);
else
    fprintf(stderr, "Error converting %s.n", string);
.ad
.fi
