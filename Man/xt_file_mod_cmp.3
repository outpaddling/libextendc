.SH DESCRIPTION

file_mod_cmp() compares the modification times of file1 and file2.
It compares modification times on two files using the same rules
as "make", and returns an strcmp(3) compatible status value indicating
which is older.  A file that doesn't exist is considered
older than the big bang.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A value < 0 if file1 is older or does not exist.
A value > 0 if file2 is older or does not exist.
0 if the files have identical modification times, or neither exists.
