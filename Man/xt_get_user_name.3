.SH DESCRIPTION

xt_get_user_name() determines the user name of the process owner.
The information is retrieved using a call to
getpwuid(3), and copied to the argument "dir".

The name is stored in user_name up to maxlen characters.
Note that up to maxlen characters are stored, not including the
null terminator, hence the buffer should be at least maxlen+1
bytes long.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A pointer to user_name, or NULL upon failure.
