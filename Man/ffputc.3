.SH DESCRIPTION

.B ffputc()
and the macro equivalent
.B FFPUTC()
write a single character to a ffile_t stream opened by ffopen(3).

The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The character written, or EOF if unable to write

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

char    *infilename, *outfilename;
ffile_t *instream, *outstream;
int     ch;

if ( (instream = ffopen(infilename, O_RDONLY)) == NULL )
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open %s for reading.n", infilename);
    exit(EX_NOINPUT);
}
if ( (outstream = ffopen(outfilename, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC)) == NULL )
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open %s for writing.n", outfilename);
    exit(EX_NOINPUT);
}
while ( (ch = FFGETC(stream)) != EOF )
    FFPUTC(ch, outstream);
ffclose(instream);
ffclose(outstream);
