.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
dsv_line_ptr    Pointer to the structure to set
c               Subscript to the delims array
new_delims_element The new value for delims[c]
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for an array element of delims member in a dsv_line_t
structure. Use this function to set an element of the array
delims in a dsv_line_t variable from non-member functions.

Note that there is an equivalent macro DSV_LINE_SET_DELIMS_AE(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_delims_element is guaranteed by other means.

dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
size_t          c;
char *          new_delims_element;

if ( dsv_line_set_delims(&dsv_line, c, new_delims_element) == DSV_DATA_OK )
