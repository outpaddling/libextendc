.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf 
.na
DSV_LINE_SET_ARRAY_SIZE(ptr, new_array_size)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a dsv_line_t structure
new_array_size  New value for array_size
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for array_size.  Use this macro to set array_size in
a dsv_line_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the dsv_line_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function dsv_line_set_array_size(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_array_size is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
size_t          new_array_size;

DSV_LINE_SET_ARRAY_SIZE(&dsv_line, new_array_size);
.ad
.fi
