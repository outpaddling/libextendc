DSV_LINE_ARRAY_SIZE(ptr)

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for array_size.  Use this macro to reference array_size in
a dsv_line_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the dsv_line_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
size_t          array_size;

array_size = DSV_LINE_ARRAY_SIZE(&dsv_line);
.ad
.fi
