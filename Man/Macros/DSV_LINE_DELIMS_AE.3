.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
DSV_LINE_DELIMS_AE(ptr, c)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a dsv_line_t structure
c               Subscript to the delims array
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for delims array elements.  Use this macro to reference
an element of delims in a dsv_line_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the dsv_line_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
size_t          c;
char *          element;

element = DSV_LINE_DELIMS_AE(&dsv_line,c);
.ad
.fi
