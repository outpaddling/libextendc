DSV_LINE_SET_FIELDS(ptr, new_fields)

.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr             Pointer to a dsv_line_t structure
new_fields      New value for fields

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for fields.  Use this macro to set fields in
a dsv_line_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the dsv_line_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function dsv_line_set_fields(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_fields is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
char **         new_fields;

DSV_LINE_SET_FIELDS(&dsv_line, new_fields);
.ad
.fi
