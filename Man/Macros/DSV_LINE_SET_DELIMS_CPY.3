.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf 
.na
DSV_LINE_SET_DELIMS_CPY(ptr, new_delims)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a dsv_line_t structure
new_delims      New value for delims
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for delims.  Use this macro to set delims in
a dsv_line_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the dsv_line_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function dsv_line_set_delims_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_delims is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
char *          new_delims[];

DSV_LINE_SET_DELIMS_CPY(&dsv_line, new_delims);
.ad
