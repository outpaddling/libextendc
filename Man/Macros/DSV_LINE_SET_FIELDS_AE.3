.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a dsv_line_t structure
c                       Subscript to fields array
new_fields_element      New value for fields[c]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for fields array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of fields in a dsv_line_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the dsv_line_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function dsv_line_set_fields_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_fields_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
size_t          c;
char **         new_fields_element;

DSV_LINE_SET_FIELDS_AE(&dsv_line, c, new_fields_element);
