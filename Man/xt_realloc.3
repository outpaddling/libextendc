void    *xt_realloc(void *array, size_t nelem, size_t size)

array:  Address of the previously allocated array
nelem:  Number of objects to allocate
size:   Size of a single object
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

xt_realloc() is a simple wrapper around realloc(3) that requires three
arguments representing the original array, the new number of objects
to allocate and the size of an element.  This prevents the very
common mistake with realloc(3) of forgetting to multiply by the size
of an element.
Specifying the size using sizeof(*variable) has the advantage of
being type-independent.  I.e. if you change the type of the variable,
this code need not be updated.

.SH EXAMPLES

#define     MAX_WIDGETS 1000
widget_t    *widgets;

widgets = xt_malloc(MAX_WIDGETS, sizeof(*widgets));
...
widgets = xt_realloc(widgets, new_widget_count, sizeof(*widgets));
