.SH DESCRIPTION

xt_get_home_dir() determines the full pathname of the process owner's
home directory.  The information is retrieved using a call to
getpwuid(3), and copied to the argument "dir".

The name is stored in dir up to maxlen characters.
Note that up to maxlen characters are stored, not including the
null terminator, hence the buffer should be at least maxlen+1
bytes long.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A pointer to dir, or NULL upon failure.
