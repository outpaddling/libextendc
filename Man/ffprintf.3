.SH DESCRIPTION

.B ffprintf(3)
writes formatted data to a ffile_t stream the same was as
fprintf(3) writes to a FILE stream.

The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The number of characters written

.na

ffile_t *stream;
int     count = 1;

if ( (stream = ffopen(filename, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC)) == NULL )
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Could not open %s.n", filename);
    exit(EX_CANTCREAT);
}
ffprintf(stream, "%dn", count);
ffclose(stream);
