.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

new_fields_element The new value for fields[c]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for an array element of fields member in a dsv_line_t
structure. Use this function to set an element of the array
fields in a dsv_line_t variable from non-member functions.

Note that there is an equivalent macro DSV_LINE_SET_FIELDS_AE(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_fields_element is guaranteed by other means.

.nf
.na

dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
size_t          c;
char **         new_fields_element;

if ( dsv_line_set_fields(&dsv_line, c, new_fields_element) == DSV_DATA_OK )
{
