.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
unsigned long xt_toc(FILE *stream, const char *message,
struct timeval *start_time, struct rusage *start_usage)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
stream      FILE stream to which output is sent
message     Optional message to print before time stats, or NULL
start_time  A struct timeval structure populated by xt_tic()
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

xt_toc() reports the elapsed time, user time, and system time
since start_time and start_usage, which should have been populated
by xt_tic(3) at the beginning of the interval being measured.
Time is reported in microseconds, and if elapsed time is greater
than one second, days, hours, and seconds are also reported.

The xt_tic() and xt_toc() functions are used to accurately determine
the elapsed time of a segment of code, such as a loop that is
suspected to be costly.  xt_tic() is inserted into the program just
before the code and xt_toc() immediately after.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The time difference in microseconds

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

struct timeval  start_time;
struct rusage   start_usage;

xt_tic(&start_time, &start_usage);
// Code for which elapsed time is to be measured
for (c = 0; c < bignum; ++c)
{
    ...
}
xt_toc(stderr, "Elapsed time for loop:n", &start_time, &start_usage);
