.SH DESCRIPTION

.B ffdopen()
initializes a ffile_t stream, much as fdopen() does for a FILE
stream.  Unlike fdopen(), ffdopen() takes the same bit mask
argument as open() to determine the open mode.
See open(3) for details.

An optimally sized buffer for the underlying filesystem is allocated,
along with additional space for limited ffungetc() operations.
The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A pointer to a ffile_t object on success, NULL on failure

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

ffile_t *stream;
char    *filename;
int     fd;

fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY);
stream = ffdopen(fd, O_RDONLY);
