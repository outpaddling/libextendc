.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ffopen(3)
opens a raw data file using ffopen() or a gzipped, bzipped, or
xzipped file using ffpopen(), returning a pointer to a ffile_t
stream.  Must be used in conjunction with
xt_ffclose() to ensure that ffclose() or ffpclose() is called where
appropriate.

The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A pointer to the FILE structure or NULL if open failed
