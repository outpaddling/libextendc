.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_inhale_strings()
reads a list of strings from a file, one per line, into a pointer
array.  Memory is allocated for the pointer array and for each
string.

Memory should be freed using xt_free_strings(3) as soon as the
strings are no longer needed.

Inhaling large amounts of data into arrays should generally be
avoided in favor of more memory-efficient use-once-and-discard
strategies, but may be advantageous for small lists of strings
accessed repeatedly, or necessary for a few tasks such as sorting.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The number of strings read, XT_READ_IO_ERR on read error

.SH EXAMPLES

FILE    *instream;
char    **strings;
ssize_t string_count;

string_count = xt_inhale_strings(instream, &strings);

xt_free_strings(strings);
