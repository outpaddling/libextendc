int     dsv_read_field(FILE *stream, char buff[], size_t buff_size,
const char *delims, size_t *len)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
stream:     FILE stream from which field is read
buff:       Character buff into which field is copied
buff_size:  Size of the array passed to buff
delims:     Array of characters that may serve as delimiters
len:        Pointer to a variable which will receive the field length

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next delimiter-separated field from stream. The fields may be
ended by any character in the string delims or by a newline ('n').

If the delimiter ending a field is a space, then subsequence spaces
are discarded, so that multiple space characters serve as a single
delimiter.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Delimiter ending the field (either a member of delim or newline)
