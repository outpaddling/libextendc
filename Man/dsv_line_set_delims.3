.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for delims member in a dsv_line_t structure.
Use this function to set delims in a dsv_line_t object
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
delims is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_DSV_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_DSV_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise
