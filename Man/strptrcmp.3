.SH DESCRIPTION

Compare two strings via indirect pointers.  This can be used by
qsort(), heapsort(), etc. to sort an argv-style pointer array,
swapping only the pointers rather than the string contents.

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 if the strings are the same, a value < 0 if the string at p1
is lexically < that at p2, a value > 0 otherwise.

.SH SEE ALSO
