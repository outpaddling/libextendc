.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
stream      FILE stream from which field is read
buff        Character buffer into which field is copied
buff_size   Size of the array passed to buff
delims      Array of characters that may serve as delimiters
len         Pointer to a variable which will receive the field length
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next delimiter-separated field from stream, allocating a
buffer to fit in the fashion of strdup(3). The fields may be
ended by any character in the string delims or by a newline ('\\n').

If the delimiter ending a field is a space, then subsequence spaces
are discarded, so that multiple space characters serve as a single
delimiter.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Delimiter ending the field (either a member of delim or newline)
or XT_MALLOC_FAILED.
