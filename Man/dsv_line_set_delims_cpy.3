.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP

.na
int     dsv_line_set_delims_cpy(dsv_line_t *dsv_line_ptr, char * new_delims, size_t array_size)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
dsv_line_ptr    Pointer to the structure to set
new_delims      The new value for delims
array_size      Size of the delims array.
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for delims member in a dsv_line_t structure.
Use this function to set delims in a dsv_line_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function copies the array pointed to
by new_delims to ->delims.

Note that there is an equivalent macro DSV_LINE_SET_DELIMS(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_delims is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
char *          new_delims;
size_t          array_size;

if ( dsv_line_set_delims(&dsv_line, new_delims, array_size) == DSV_DATA_OK )
{
}
