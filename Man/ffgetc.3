.SH DESCRIPTION

.B ffgetc()
and the macro equivalent
.B FFGETC()
read a single character from a ffile_t stream opened by ffopen(3).

The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The character read, or EOF if no more data are available

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

ffile_t *stream;
int     ch;

if ( (stream = ffopen(filename, O_RDONLY)) == NULL )
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open %s for reading.n", filename);
    exit(EX_NOINPUT);
}
while ( (ch = FFGETC(stream)) != EOF )
{
}
ffclose(stream);
