.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
uint64_t    xt_factorial(unsigned n)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
n   Integer in the range [0,20] (inclusive) for which n! is returned.
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Instantaneous factorial for n in [0,20] using a lookup table.

Note that 21! is beyond the range of uint64_t, so programs that
need it should either use a multiple precision library or rearrange
the computations to avoid repeated multiplication leading to overflow.
n_choose_k(3) uses the latter approach to avoid computing whole
factorials before finally dividing.

.SH RETURN VALUES

n! if n is an element of [0,20], 0 otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

#include <inttypes.h>

printf("%" PRIu64, factorial(20));

.fi
