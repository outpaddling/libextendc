.SH DESCRIPTION

.B ffungetc()
returns a single character read by ffgetc(3) to the input buffer of
a stream opened by ffopen(3).  All characters from the most recently
read block plus a maximum of XT_FAST_FILE_UNGETC_MAX characters
from the previously read block may be returned.

The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The character written, or EOF if unable to write

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

char    *infilename;
ffile_t *instream;
int     ch;

if ( (instream = ffopen(infilename, O_RDONLY)) == NULL )
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open %s for reading.n", infilename);
    exit(EX_NOINPUT);
}
if ( (ch = FFGETC(instream)) != MY_FAVORITE_CHAR )
    ffungetc(ch, instream);
ffclose(instream);
