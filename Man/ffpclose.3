.SH DESCRIPTION

.B ffpclose(3)
closes a stream opened by ffpopen(3), and
waits for the child process to complete and returns its
exit status.

The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Exit status of the child process spawned by ffpopen(3), or -1 on error

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

ffile_t *instream;

if ( (instream = ffpopen("xzcat file.xz", O_RDONLY)) == NULL )
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to read xzcat file.xz.n");
    exit(EX_NOINPUT);
}

ffpclose(instream);
