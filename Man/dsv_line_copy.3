.SH DESCRIPTION

Duplicate an arbitrary dsv_line_t object, allocating space for
fields and delimiters as needed.
The dsv_line_t structure contains an array of strings, each
holding one field from the line, and an an array of delimiters,
each holding the character that ended the corresponding field.
Note that each field could potentially end with a different
delimiter, as multiple delimiters can be specified.
