.SH DESCRIPTION

strlbasecpy() is a convenience for copying a string to a non-zero
starting position in another string.  The caller provides the address
of the destination to which string should be copied, the base address
of the array containing the destination, and the TOTAL length of the
destination array.  strlbasecpy() then computes the distance from
the destination address to the end of the array and like strlcpy(),
prevents overrun from occurring.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The original value of dest
