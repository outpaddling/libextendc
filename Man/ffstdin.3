.SH DESCRIPTION

.B ffstdin()
is a simple wrapper function for connecting file descriptor 0
to an ffile_t object using ffdopen(3).  This is useful for
high-performance filter programs, where using the traditional
FILE *stdin would cause a bottleneck.

The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Pointer to an ffile_t object if successful, NULL otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

ffile_t *stream;

// "-" as a filename argument traditionally indicates stdin
if ( strcmp(argv[arg], "-") == 0 )
    stream = ffstdin();
else
    stream = ffopen(argv[arg], O_RDONLY);
