.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for num_fields member in a xt_ff_dsv_line_t structure.
Use this function to set num_fields in a xt_ff_dsv_line_t object
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
num_fields is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

.SH RETURN VALUES

DSV_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
DSV_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise
