.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for array_size member in a dsv_line_t structure.
Use this function to set array_size in a dsv_line_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
array_size is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_array_size is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
size_t          new_array_size;

if ( dsv_line_set_array_size(&dsv_line, new_array_size) == DSV_DATA_OK )
{
