.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ff_printf(3)
writes formatted data to a xt_ffile_t stream the same was as
fprintf(3) writes to a FILE stream.

The xt_ff_ile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The number of characters written

    exit(EX_CANTCREAT);
}
