xt_dsv_line_ptr    Pointer to the structure to set
new_array_size  The new value for array_size

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for array_size member in a xt_dsv_line_t structure.
Use this function to set array_size in a xt_dsv_line_t object
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
array_size is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

.SH RETURN VALUES

DSV_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
DSV_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.na

xt_dsv_line_t      xt_dsv_line;
size_t          new_array_size;

if ( xt_dsv_line_set_array_size(&xt_dsv_line, new_array_size)
        == DSV_DATA_OK )
