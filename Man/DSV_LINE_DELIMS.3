.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for delims.  Use this macro to reference delims in
a dsv_line_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the dsv_line_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
dsv_line_t      dsv_line;
char *          delims;

delims = DSV_LINE_DELIMS(&dsv_line);
.ad
.fi
