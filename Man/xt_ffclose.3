.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ffclose(3)
closes a ffile_t stream with ffclose() or ffpclose() as appropriate.
Automatically determines the proper close function to call using
S_ISFIFO on the stream stat structure.

The ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The value returned by ffclose() or ffpclose()
