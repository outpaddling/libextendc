.SH DESCRIPTION

difftimeofday() returns the difference, in microseconds, between two
time values returned by gettimeofday(3).  This function can be used
to get a good estimate of the real time elapsed in a process between
any two points (where calls to gettimeofday(3) are strategically
placed.)

Use of these functions should have minimal impact on run time,
unless called many times to measure time of a function with a very
short run time.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The difference between the two times in microseconds

.SH SEE ALSO

gettimeofday(2), xt_tic(3), xt_toc(3)
