.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for num_fields member in a dsv_line_t structure.
Use this function to set num_fields in a dsv_line_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
num_fields is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_num_fields is guaranteed by other means.

dsv_line_t      dsv_line;

if ( dsv_line_set_num_fields(&dsv_line, new_num_fields) == DSV_DATA_OK )
