.SH DESCRIPTION

xt_tic() records the current time in a struct timeval structure.
It is a simple wrapper around gettimeofday(2) meant for use with
xt_toc(3), which reports elapsed time since the xt_tic() call.

The xt_tic() and xt_toc() functions are used to accurately determine
the elapsed time of a segment of code, such as a loop that is
suspected to be costly.  xt_tic() is inserted into the program just
before the code and xt_toc() immediately after.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The exit status of gettimeofday(2)

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

struct timeval  start_time;
struct rusage   start_usage;

xt_tic(&start_time, &start_usage);
// Code for which elapsed time is to be measured
for (c = 0; c < bignum; ++c)
{
    ...
}
xt_toc(stderr, "Elapsed time for loop:n", &start_time, &start_usage);
