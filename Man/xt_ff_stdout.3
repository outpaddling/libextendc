.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ff_stdout()
is a simple wrapper function for connecting file descriptor 1
to an xt_ffile_t object using xt_ff_dopen(3).  This is useful for
high-performance filter programs, where using the traditional
FILE *stdout would cause a bottleneck.

The xt_ffile_t system is simpler than and several times as
fast as FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Pointer to an xt_ffile_t object if successful, NULL otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

xt_ffile_t *stream;

// "-" as a filename argument traditionally indicates stdout
if ( strcmp(argv[arg], "-") == 0 )
    stream = xt_ff_stdout();
else
    stream = xt_ff_open(argv[arg], O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC);
