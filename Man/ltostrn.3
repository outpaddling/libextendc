.SH DESCRIPTION

ltostrn() is a small, fast integer to string converter that can
convert using any base from 2 to 36.  It is the converse of strtol(3).
The size of the char buffer passed should be 1 more than maxlen to
allow for a null byte.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A pointer to the converted string, or NULL if the string buffer was
not big enough for all the digits
