.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
char    *parse_cmd(char *argv[], const char *cmd)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
argv:   Pointer array to be filled with command tokens
cmd:    Raw command string with limited meta-character support
from strshellcpy(3)
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Breaks a shell command into an argv[] style array suitable
for spawnvp() or execv*().  A copy of cmd is created using
strshellcpy(), which expands certain shell features such as
variables and paths starting with '~'.  The copy is then
modified by replacing separators with '0' and the argv[] array
is populated with pointers to each token in the copy.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

char *cmd, *argv[], *expanded_cmd;

expanded_cmd = parse_cmd(argv, cmd);
spawnvp(P_WAIT, P_NOECHO, argv, NULL, NULL, NULL);
free(expanded_cmd);
.ad
.fi
