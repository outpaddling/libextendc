.SH DESCRIPTION

xt_fgetline() reads a line of text from a FILE stream.  Input is
terminated when a newline or end of file is encountered,
or when maxlen characters have been read.  Note that up to maxlen
characters may be stored, NOT INCLUDING THE NULL TERMINATOR BYTE,
hence the buffer should be at least maxlen+1 bytes long. Unlike
fgets(3), fgetline() does not store the trailing newline character
in the string.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The number of bytes read, or EOF if EOF is encountered before a newline

.SH SEE ALSO

fgets(3)
